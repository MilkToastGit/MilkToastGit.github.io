			“It is my dream to work in a small team of like-minded people to
			develop games that will impact people in the same way that I have
			been impacted by some of my favourite games and I am prepared to 
			do whatever it takes to make that dream a reality.”

			“I have been interested in video games and game development since 
			I was a child and would often spend time with my friends making up
			fake game studios and planning out our (very overambitious) lineup
			of games. For roughly three years I have been teaching myself C# and
			developing prototypes and small games in Unity but have yet to make
			a full game start to finish. At the beginning of 2021 I started 
			studying game development at SAE Institute in Perth and I have been
			pushing myself to learn and improve as much as I can.”
