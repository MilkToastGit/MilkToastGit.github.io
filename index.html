					“I have been interested in video games and game development since
					I was a child and would often spend time with my friends making up
					fake game studios and planning out our (very overambitious) lineup
					of games. For roughly three years I have been teaching myself C# and
					developing prototypes and small games in Unity but have yet to make
					a full game start to finish. At the beginning of 2021 I started
					studying game development at SAE Institute in Perth and I have been
					pushing myself to learn and improve as much as I can.”
