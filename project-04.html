			<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of this project was to create a polished 3D asset using modelling
				software, create or record an audio asset, import them into a game engine,
				and create a UI that interacts with the scene in a way that might mimic
				how a UI would interact with the game world in an actual game.

			<h2>KEY SKILLS</h2>
			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>
						As the lead programmer for this project I was in charge of creating
						all the scripts that hold the game together and allow the game to run
						as well as a good portion of the scripts used by the microgames. These
						scripts include event, input, audio and UI managers, scriptable objects
						to hold microgame information and script to cast the mouse cursor's position
						onto a specified plane in world space for moving around physics objects.
					</p>

			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>Project Management</h3>
					<p>
						As this project was the largest one I had undertaken so far, taking
						place over the entire trimester, and was in collaboration with other
						students, management was very important to make sure we were keeping
						track of what needed to be done and that we were on schedule. We used
						<a href="https://trello.com/b/fWdRh96A/5pm-dev-board">Trello</a> to
						assign tasks to group members, a burn-down chart to keep track of
						remaining tasks and GitKraken to manage our individual changes to
						the <a href="https://github.com/Hoboninja69/5PM-I-m-Outta-Here">
						project repository</a>.
