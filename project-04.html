			<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of this project was to create a polished 3D asset using modelling
				software, create or record an audio asset, import them into a game engine,
				and create a UI that interacts with the scene in a way that might mimic
				how a UI would interact with the game world in an actual game.

			<h2>KEY SKILLS</h2>
			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>
						I used a variety of 3D modelling techniques inside of blender to create
						the shape of the horn. Some of these techniques include extrusion,
						beveling and tapering a path, merging vertices and proportional editing.
						I created a simple UV map and textured the model with flat colours,
						a metallic map and a roughness map.
					</p>

			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>Game Design</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first time using Unreal Engine instead of Unity and although
						there are many differences between the two, I was able to learn how
						to import assets, set up a scene and use blueprints to allow the UI
						button to interact with the scene and play a sound.
