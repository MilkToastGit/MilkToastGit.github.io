			<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
			<p>
				The goal of this project was to create a polished 3D asset using modelling
				software, create or record an audio asset, import them into a game engine,
				and create a UI that interacts with the scene in a way that might mimic
				how a UI would interact with the game world in an actual game.

			<h2>KEY SKILLS</h2>
			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>3D Modelling</h3>
					<p>
						Throughout this project I used many different techniques and tools 
						inside of blender to create the individual parts while maintaining
						good topology. I also used UV unwrapping to apply the textures to 
						the products and the machine itself and minimise distortion.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>2D Asset Creation</h3>
					<p>
						I used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create all the textures 
						for the products inside the vending machine as well as the labels
						on the machine itself. The drawing was done by my friend 
						<a href="https://twitter.com/zomokii" target="_blank">Zomoki</a> and I used
						Photoshop to add the text and place it on the machine.
					</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="skill">
				  <h3>Unreal Scene Creation</h3>
					<p>
						In Unreal I set up the scene to showcase the model and animated
						multiple camera shots focusing on different parts. Using blueprints,
						I created the functionality for the UI and using the material
						editor I applied all the textures I had created to the models
						along with refraction for the transparent products.
