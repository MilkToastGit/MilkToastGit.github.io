				<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
				<p>
					As students, we were tasked to create a simple platformer in which the
					player can move around and interact with objects within the game world.
					We were then asked to modify this simple game by adding or changing
					mechanics and design a level around these mechanics.

				<h2>KEY SKILLS</h2>
				<div class="skill">
						<h3>Programming</h3>
						<p>
							I used C# to code a multitude of scripts that allow the game to
							function including player movment, enemy behaviour, pickups and a
							camera controller. Two key techniques I demonstrated as per the brief's
							requirements are component-based programming and communication between
							scripts using events.
						</p>
				</div>

				<div class="skill">
						<h3>Game Design</h3>
						<p>
							I used my experience playing games myself to guide most my decisions
							and followed some techniques used by other games such as implementing
							'Coyote Time.' I also used this brief knowledge to design a simple level
							which attempts to show off all the items I created and teach the player
							how they work.
						</p>
				</div>

				<div class="skill">
						<h3>Scope and Time Management</h3>
						<p>
							Throughout the project I made sure to keep my goals realistic and not
							get overambitious with adding features and mechanics and prioritised
							tasks based on importance and how long they would take to complete.
